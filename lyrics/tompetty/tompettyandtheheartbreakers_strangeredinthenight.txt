"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - Strangered In The Night Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Well it was dark at midnight There was hardly any moon And no one really saw much No one was really sure But something didn't seem right Something was kinda queer A roar turned into whispers Everyone stood there As the sound split the night They ran hiding from the light Like strangers in the night Like strangers in the night Well I didn't see no shotgun No, I didn't see no knife But I saw this crazy black guy With the demon in his eye And I heard him say, \"White man\" I've seen that silver cue You don't remember me well But I remember you As the sound split the night They ran hiding from the light Like strangers in the night Like strangers in the night Well the knife just left his fingers As the black guy took his aim White guy's head exploded The black guy howled in pain Then everybody scattered I heard some woman scream God damn you old black bastard You've blown away my dreams As the sound just split the night They ran hiding from the light Like strangers in the night Strangers in the night Strangers in the night Strangers in the night"
