"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - Baby's A Rock 'N' Roller Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n My baby is a rock 'n' roller My baby is a rock 'n' roller Yeah, that's all that she ever wants to be So why you trying to come on with this sophistication? She don't wanna know about your education Man, she don't care about the United Nations My baby's gone on a rhythm sensation That's all she ever wants to be My baby is a rock 'n' roller Well, she can't take them stupid friends of yours She ain't going to go through all of that no more She don't wanna be no dentist assistant Man, she got the rhythm and she can't resist it That's all she ever wants to be My baby is a rock 'n' roller My baby is a rock 'n' roller My baby is a rock 'n' roller My baby is a rock 'n' roller"
