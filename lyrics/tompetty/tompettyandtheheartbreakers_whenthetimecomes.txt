"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - When The Time Comes Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n This might sound strange, might seem dumb Depends on the side that you take it in from Depends on the time, depends on the day Depends on a lot of things, who can say I just want to let you know that I will stand by you Through whatever might come, wherever you run Will you stand by me when the time comes? Baby do you understand? Am I making this clear? Are you tuning me out 'cause I'm coming off weird? Well I don't care, that's all right That's okay, I don't mind I just want to let you know that I will stand by you Through whatever might come, wherever you run Will you stand by me when the time comes? This ain't the right time to say what's on my mind I know, but I look in your eyes And there is no real life at all Baby, hold on And someday soon you'll come around You'll know where I can be found When your heart feels right, seek me out We can talk more then babe, but right now I just want to let you know that I will stand by you Through whatever might come, wherever you run Will you stand by me when the time comes?"
