"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - Too Much Ain't Enough Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Looks like you got a little more to lose now Little more at stake I see you had a hard time Living with the change You got me on the line Now trying to call your bluff You just won't be satisfied Too much ain't enough It ain't enough It ain't enough Yeah, you're standing by the telephone Waiting for the word And ever since that bathroom scene There's been a slight concern I'm trying to make this easy, baby You seem to like things rough You just can't be satisfied Too much ain't enough It ain't enough Too much ain't enough Too much ain't enough Come on baby, I'm down on my knees Guess some little girls just can't be pleased Little Miss Queen of Hearts You're a strange thing Why you want to make so vague? I'm wandering through this mess you made To see what I can save I'm living on the line now Trying to call your bluff But you just won't be satisfied Too much ain't enough It ain't enough It ain't enough It ain't enough"
