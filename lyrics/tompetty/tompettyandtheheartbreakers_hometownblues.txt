"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - Hometown Blues Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Baby can't wait, baby gotta go Gotta do a number on a late-night show Do a little song, do a little dance Gonna make the best of her big chance It don't really matter if she don't or if she do Just trying to make the best of the hometown blues Blues I got a friend, got a little girl Say she's the best in the whole wide world Said it's so good, said it so unreal Might not last, but it's no big deal It don't really matter if she don't or if she do Just trying to make the best of the hometown blues Blues Baby, save me, save me Save me with your sweet smile Honey, I really need you To help me kill a little bit of time All of the girls run with the crowd They go wild when the lights go down They got a little money, little in a dream Wanna be the queen of their little scene Don't really matter if they don't or if they do They're trying to make the best of the hometown blues Blues Blues, blues, blues, blues"
