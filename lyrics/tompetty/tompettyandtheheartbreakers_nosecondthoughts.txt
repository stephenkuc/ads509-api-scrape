"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - No Second Thoughts Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n She threw down her golden band Crushed it with her feet into the sand Took her silent partner by the hand Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Somewhere near the edge of town She said she was torn and turned around \"Can you help me cast this evil down?\" Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah We'll drive for the line now There's nothing to be lost You and I will cross over With no second thoughts We'll drive for the line now There's nothing to be lost You and I will cross over With no second thoughts Dreams fade hope dies hard She cups her eyes and looks out at the stars Says, \"I feel we've travelled very far.\" Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah Yeah yeah oh yeah yeah"
