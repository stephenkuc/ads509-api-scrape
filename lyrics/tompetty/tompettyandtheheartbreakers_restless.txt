"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - Restless Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n I don't need to belong to no one I don't belong at all I got my face in a corner Got my back to the wall Yeah, pretty baby, I'm restless, restless Restless through and through I'm restless, restless You look restless too I'm a hair-trigger lover And I can't face up to nothing I'm impatient with the wind But I'm waiting here for something Pretty baby, I'm restless, restless Restless through and through I'm restless, restless You look restless too Restless sleep, twisted dreams Moving targets, silent screams Restless city, restless street Restless you, restless me I'm a face out the window I'm a black satin sheet And I can't stay warm I stay out in the street Yeah, pretty baby, I'm restless, restless Restless through and through I'm restless, restless You look restless too"
