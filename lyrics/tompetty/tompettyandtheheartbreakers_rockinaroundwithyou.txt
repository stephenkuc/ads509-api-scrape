"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - Rockin' Around (With You) Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Why be lonely Why be blue You got me babe, I got you And I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you How I dig rockin' around with you I was waiting You came through You knew no one else will do And I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you How I dig rockin' around with you You know I dig rockin' around You know I dig rockin' around You know I dig rockin' around"
