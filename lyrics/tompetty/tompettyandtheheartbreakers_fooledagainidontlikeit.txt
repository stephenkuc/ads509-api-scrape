"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - Fooled Again (I Don't Like It) Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Strange voice on the telephone Tellin' me I better leave you 'lone Why don't somebody say what's going on Uh oh I think I been through this before Looks like I'm the fool again Looks like I'm the fool again I don't like it I don't like it You never said you had no number two I need to know about it if you do If two is one I might as well be three It's good to see you think so much of me Looks like I'm the fool again Looks like I'm the fool again I don't like it I don't like it Look out! You never said you had no number two I need to know about it if you do If two is one I might as well be three It's good to see you think so much of me Looks like I'm the fool again Looks like I'm the fool again I don't like it I don't like it Look out! I don't like it I don't like it I don't like it"
