"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - Anything That's Rock 'N' Roll Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Some friends of mine and me stayed up all through the night Rockin' pretty steady 'til the sky went light And didn't go to bed Didn't go to work I picked up the telephone Told the boss he was a jerk Your mama don't like it when you run around with me But we got to hip your mama That you got to live free Don't need her Don't need school You don't like your daddy and you don't like rules So, c'mon, baby, let's go Don't you hear the rock 'n' roll playin' on the radio Sound so right? Girl, your better grab hold Everybody's got to know Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine Oh oh oh my little baby I'm a little bit shakin' I'm a little bit crazy But I know what I want I want it right now While the 'lectric guitars are playin' way up loud C'mon, baby, let's go Don't you hear the rock 'n' roll playin' on the radio Sound so right? C'mon, baby, grab hold Everybody's got to know Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine Anything that's rock 'n' roll's fine"
