"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - Magnolia Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n From a table across the room She was signaling me with her eyes I walked over to be introduced I said, \"Hello\", she just smiled And said, \"I know a place not too far from here Where we could get away for a while\" Yeah, that's when she kissed me and told me her name I never did tell her mine Magnolia I remember the smell of the wind through the suite Magnolia And I know that she's out there somewhere in the world She's forgotten me, but I remember her Magnolia Well her lips were as warm As that wet southern night Her eyes were as black as the sky And I wondered aloud Just what I had done right As I lay there with her by my side Then she took hold my hand As she looked up at me And said, \"Now I must tell you goodbye\" And there in the moonlight As I watched her leave I felt a chill down inside Magnolia I remember the smell of the wind through the suite Magnolia And I know that she's out there somewhere in the world She's forgotten me, but I remember her Magnolia"
