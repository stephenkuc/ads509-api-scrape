"Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - The Wild One Forever Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Well, the moon sank as the wind blew And the street lights slowly died Yeah they call you the wild one Said stay away from her Said she couldn't love no one if she tried But then something I saw in your eyes Told me right away That you were gonna have to be mine One of the strangest feeling came over me down inside No matter what it takes I'll never get over how good it felt When you finally held me I will never regret, baby Those few hours linger on in my head forever Well it's too bad but I want you To know I understand Yeah it's been a long time But I don't mind, yeah it's all right I understand Because something I saw in your eyes Told me right away That you were gon' have to be mine And the strangest feeling came over me down inside I knew right away I'd never get over how good it felt When you finally kissed me I will never regret, baby Baby, those few hours linger on in my head forever And ever"
