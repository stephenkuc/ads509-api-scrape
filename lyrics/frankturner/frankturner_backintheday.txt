"Frank Turner - Back In The Day Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n When I was just a skinny lad on holiday by the sea, I met a girl in a Rancid shirt, and a tape she gave to me With the Black Flag First Four Years and the Minor Threat Discography, And punk rock saved my life. Going down the Red Eye back in 1998, Hanging out with Household Names and staying out too late, This angry adolescent found an outlet for his hate, And punk rock saved my life. The vision wasn\u2019t perfect and we knew it all along, We dressed like fucking idiots and got our facts all wrong. But everyone must needs be an extremist when they\u2019re young \u2013 Fucking with your parents makes you grow up big and strong. Folding zines and record sleeves while sitting round at home, Flicking through the catalogues and distros at the shows, Circle pits and sing-a-longs, come on let\u2019s fucking go, And punk rock saved my life. That little dream is over, it was never going to last. Everybody\u2019s moved along and it\u2019s all in the past, But when I was just 16 I pinned my colours to the mast. And punk rock\u2019s in the ink that\u2019s in my skin, The attitude in every song I sing, And we didn\u2019t change the world, we didn\u2019t win, We probably didn\u2019t even save my life, it\u2019s true But I bet we had a better time than you."
