"Frank Turner - The Ballad Of Me And My Friends Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Everybody\u2019s got themselves a plan, Everybody thinks they\u2019ll be the man, including the girls. The musicians who lack the friends to form a band are singer-songwriters, The rest of us are DJ\u2019s or official club photographers. And tonight I\u2019m playing another Nambucca show, So I\u2019m going through my phonebook, texting everyone I know, And I quite a few I don\u2019t, whose numbers found their way into my phone, But they might come along anyway, you never really know. None of this is going anywhere \u2013 Pretty soon we\u2019ll all be old, And no one left alive will really care About our glory days, when we sold our souls. But if you\u2019re all about the destination, then take a fucking flight. We\u2019re going nowhere slowly, but we\u2019re seeing all the sights. And we\u2019re definitely going to hell, But we\u2019ll have all the best stories to tell."
