"Frank Turner - Romantic Fatigue Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n I have to admit that I am one of the many Who thought that a guitar would win him a lady. My teenage years, they were a feminine drought, And I thought that a serenade would help out. And it seemed to be working for a couple of years \u2013 I wrote a few songs and they wrought a few tears. But when I hit my twenties, it ran out of steam. I seemed to be suffering from romantic fatigue. And I never know which song I should play her \u2013 Each melody is a memory of a not-forgotten failure. So when I get out my guitar tonight to do what I do, Remember, I probably didn\u2019t write this song for you. So as I have mentioned, the shelf-life was short. The scheme wasn\u2019t working, despite what I thought. The ladies all left me alone in the end, So I had to switch all the names around and then sing it again. And every life-long love, and every best friend, Slipped away into the past. Take my words with caution \u2013 I can\u2019t pretend that you\u2019re the first, You won\u2019t be the last. I never know which song I should play her \u2013 Each melody is a memory of a not-forgotten failure. So when I get out my guitar tonight to do what I do, Remember, I probably didn\u2019t write this song, No I certainly didn\u2019t write this song, No I never, never wrote a song for you."
