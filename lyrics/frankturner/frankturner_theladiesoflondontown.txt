"Frank Turner - The Ladies Of London Town Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n There\u2019s so many beautiful girls in here tonight, I can hardly stand it. Where do they go during the day? Who the hell do they go home with at the end of the night? I don\u2019t understand it. They never go home with me. You dance as if you\u2019re hours away from death, You\u2019re wearing too much make-up and showing too much flesh, And you smile a smile to take away my breath, Because tonight, and only tonight, you know you\u2019re the best. The ladies of London town Go flowing through these streets like water Running little streams down to the river. They wash the dirty ground, they sweep me off my feet, But like an English summer, they\u2019ll soon be gone forever. I\u2019ve seen you trawling Camden at 4am, Outside of the clubnight, Deciding whose house will hold a free-for-all. I\u2019ve followed you back to mansions and I\u2019ve met all your friends Under the streetlights But I can never recall what you\u2019re called. You dance, you sweat, Your glance is met, And you hold my gaze a bit, And pretend you never did, And I\u2019m left standing on my own. The ladies of London town throw one last glance over their shoulders, Blow a kiss, and then they\u2019re gone forever."
