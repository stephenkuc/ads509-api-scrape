"Frank Turner - Father's Day Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n When I was sixteen I cut myself a Mohawk, Because I wanted to walk the walk, And not just talk the talk, But it was a bit of a disaster because I did the sides with kitchen scissors, Because I didn\u2019t have any clippers, And I didn\u2019t want to use a beard-trimmer \u2013 I\u2019d made that mistake before. When you got home you didn\u2019t want to talk about what I\u2019d done. You said I\u2019d let you down, I\u2019d fucked around, when I was only having fun. With the way that you\u2019ve been lately, you\u2019ve no right to scream and shout. You and I, we\u2019ve got a lot that we need to talk about. What\u2019s the point in making vows that you\u2019re never going to keep? A lifetime lying awake means you\u2019ll never get to sleep. And all the promises you made, that were painful and untrue, Of all the things you do they reflect worst on you. We all have our own devices For handling mid-life crises \u2013 Usually involves a motorbike and Suspicious fashion decisions. But you choose to stave off grey hairs by Lamely hacking at the sides With lies and flimsy alibis For your suspicious expeditions. When I get home I don\u2019t want to talk about what you\u2019ve done. Yes you\u2019ve let me down, you\u2019ve fucked around, but I guess you were having fun. With the way that I\u2019ve been lately, I\u2019ve no right to scream and shout. You and I, we\u2019ve got a lot that we need to talk about. You always told me Father\u2019s Day was just another way Of selling Hallmark greeting cards Twenty Years of waking sleep, of lying through your teeth, Meant every Father\u2019s Day spent wondering who the hell you are. What\u2019s the point in us making vows that we\u2019re never going to keep? I keep trying to keep you up, but you keep on falling asleep. And all the promises we made were painful and untrue, But for better or for worse, I am turning into you."
