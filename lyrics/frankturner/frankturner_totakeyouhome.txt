"Frank Turner - To Take You Home Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n I come from the land of the Wessex down From the Hampshire hills near Winchester town In the country where the soft South rivers flow down To English channel I roam, this is where I call home I sing for my supper and I'm pretty well fed My cross is silent and I make my bed Where I can find a crown and somewhere to lay my head And the travelling day is done, and all my songs have been sung But honey I was lonely on the road, I was all on my own Hanging outside at the back of a death metal show I saw you standing there with your hair down low A kink in your step that made me want to know If you would like to take me home Who'd of thought that a French kiss from a Parisian girl could capture an English boy She comes from the channels of a distant shore From the land of revolution and Agincourt From the Kings blood stain on a tricolour And the culture a little too high, for an English boy like me She doesn't know the Island I grew up upon The valleys and the hills that I've roamed along And she doesn't like my clothes and she doesn't like my songs But she's still my Mademoiselle and it goes to show you never can tell. Cos she was a quiet one She was a shy one She was the prettiest at the show She crept up so slowly She crept up behind me But still she pretended that she didn't know But all that she thinks of me, and she kissed me And she's yet to let me go though I'm far away Across of sea I'm singing for the hope that she would ever remember me So honey when you're lonely on the road, you're all on your own Hanging outside at the back of the country show Picture me there with hat down low A smile upon my face to let you know That I would like to take you home That I would like to take you home, to the hills that I know I would like to take you home, to the places I go I would like to take you home And that's the way that a French kiss from an English boy can capture a Parisian girl"
