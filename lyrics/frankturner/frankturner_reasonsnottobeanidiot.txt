"Frank Turner - Reasons Not To Be An Idiot Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n You're not as messed up as you think you are Your self-absorption makes you messier Just settle down and you will feel a whole lot better Deep down you're just like everybody else She's not as pretty as she thinks she is Just picture her after she's had kids I bet she sits at home and listens to The Smiths Deep down she's just like everybody else So why are you sat at home? You're not designed to be alone You just got used to saying \"no\" So get up and get down and get outside 'Cause it's a lovely sunny day But you hide yourself away You've only got yourself to blame Get up and get down and get outside He's not as clever as he likes to think He's just ambitious with his arguing He's crap at dancing, yeah and he can't hold his drink Deep down he's just like everybody else I'm not as awesome as this song makes out I'm angry, underweight and sketching out I'm building bonfires on my vanities and doubts To get warm just like everybody else So why are you sat at home? You're not designed to be alone You just got used to saying \"no\" So get up and get down and get outside 'Cause it's a lovely sunny day But you hide yourself away You've only got yourself to blame Get up and get down and get outside Amy thinks that life is lacking in drama So she fell for horoscopes, fake healing and karma She's so wrapped up in her invisible armour She'll never grow into herself And it's OK thinking me and all my friends are just wasters But saying that I can still see through her heirs and graces I bet she's scared her life won't leave any traces Caught up like everyone else That's not the point anyway Oh darling, I felt compelled to call you up to say... So why are you sat at home? You're not designed to be alone You just got used to saying \"no\" So get up and get down and get outside 'Cause it's a lovely sunny day But you hide yourself away You've only got yourself to blame Get up and get down and get outside Get up and get down and get outside Get up and get down and get outside Get up and get down and get outside Get up and get down and get outside Get up and get down and get outside"
