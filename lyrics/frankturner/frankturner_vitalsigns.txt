"Frank Turner - Vital Signs Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n This country is my canvas \u2013 I leave paint trails as I go. I\u2019m painting a picture That you can only see from outer space. My bedroom is your sofa, I take my breakfast on the train. I\u2019m tired and I\u2019m dirty, and not a second goes to waste. I\u2019ll be dead but never dying, and I say that with a smile It\u2019s just my way of trying to be alive. Well I\u2019ll never get to grey hair And I\u2019ll never be in the black, But I can tell stories that most can hardly dream. Dreaming is a luxury, Like stopping-staring and beauty sleep. I\u2019ll stop when I\u2019m finished, And sleep is for the weak. Heaven\u2019s in the half-light, and that\u2019s where I reside, A whiskey and a wry smile \u2013 I check my vital signs. And when I\u2019m gone, The worlds revolve, and life goes on, So mark no grave, Forget my name. If the song remains And everybody\u2019s got a drink and a smile, Well, that\u2019s just fine by me."
