"Frank Turner - Photosynthesis Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n 1,2,1,2,3 Well I guess I should confess that I am starting to get old All the latest music fads all passed me by and left me cold All the kids are talking slang I won't pretend to understand All my friends are getting married, mortgages and pension plans And it's obvious my angry adolescent days are done And I'm happy and I'm settled in the person I've become But that doesn't mean I'm settled up and sitting out the game Time may change a lot but some things may stay the same And I won't sit down And I won't shut up And most of all I will not grow up And I won't sit down And I won't shut up And most of all I yeah I won't grow up Oh maturity's a wrapped up package deal so it seems And ditching teenage fantasy means ditching all your dreams All your friends and peers and family solemnly tell you you will Have to grow up be an adult yeah be bored and unfulfilled Oh when no ones yet explained to me exactly what's so great About slaving 50 years away on something that you hate, about meekly shuffling down the path of mediocrity Well if that's your road then take it but it's not the road for me And I won't sit down And I won't shut up And most of all I will not grow up And I won't sit down And I won't shut up And most of all I yeah I won't grow up And I won't sit down And I won't shut up And most of all I will not grow up And if all you ever do with your life Is photosynthesize Then you deserve every hour of these sleepless nights That you waste wondering when you're gonna die Now I'll play and you sing The perfect way for the evening to begin Now I'll play and you sing The perfect way for the evening to begin And I won't sit down And I won't shut up And most of all yeah I won't grow up And I won't sit down And I won't shut up And most of all I will not grow up And I won't sit down And I won't shut up And most of all I will not grow up"
