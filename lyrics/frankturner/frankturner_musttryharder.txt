"Frank Turner - Must Try Harder Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Mother loves me still despite My failing health and lack of drive. Shame on me, I could be so much better than I am. Songs unfinished, post unopened, Clothes unwashed and vows now broken. Shame on me, I could be so much better than I am. If I could just relax, then I could admit That I don\u2019t know what I want, but this is not it. If I could just recall the dreams I had as a kid, If I could just relax, if I could let my guard slip, I\u2019d be such a winner."
