"Frank Turner - Imperfect Tense Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Naked and retched and retching on a hotel bathroom floor, Somewhere in the City Three days no sleeping, not eating, not feeling good anymore Drenched in sweat and self-pity now, it's not a pretty sight What to say in my defense, I was imperfect tense Used to have such balance, but I don't know where it went So won't you be my present sense Breaking, I'm shaking, it's taking a long long time To come down off this murderous medication Trying to remember, my reasons for running myself into the ground with such dedication What to say in my defense, I was imperfect tense Used to have such balance, but I don't know where it went So won't you be my present sense, sense Cos it's not meant to be I am lost at sea So mermaids sing to me Of the better times and the things that can be Like the diamonds in the Mediterranean sea Or the beatings and sleeping and times that I took And of washing the drink and the drugs from my blood And I've nothing to say in my defense I'm far from perfect I'm still tense They say that love can change you once Please say that love can change me once Come on change me"
