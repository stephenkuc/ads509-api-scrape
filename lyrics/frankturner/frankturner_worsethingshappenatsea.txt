"Frank Turner - Worse Things Happen At Sea Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n Honestly, relax my dear, it\u2019s clear that we are done. It doesn\u2019t take a scientist to figure out that one. It\u2019s obvious, the way you move, the way you hold your head, The way you hide your pretty eyes and shift across the bed. Honestly, I\u2019ll be fine, this isn\u2019t my first time. I\u2019ve taken blows before and every time I have survived. You made it clear you didn\u2019t care, you never did pretend, And in the end at least you never try to fuck my friends. Well honestly it doesn\u2019t matter, I know better than To cry over spilt milk, wasted effort, spoiled plans. We\u2019re adults here so shed no tears, I\u2019m sure we can be friends. I\u2019ll nod and smile and watch you in the arms of other men. Well honestly, your honesty, it has emerged unscathed, And I hope you\u2019re doing fine, because me, I\u2019m doing fucking great. And I wouldn\u2019t want to waste another second of your time \u2013 I know my place, I know your face, So you hide yours and I\u2019ll keep to mine. You say \u201cWorse things happen at sea\u201d, I say \u201cWorse things have happened to me\u201d. Bitter eyes to the bedroom floor \u2013 And we\u2019re not going to talk anymore, We\u2019ve got nothing to talk for, And you\u2019ve got nothing to be sorry for. And I\u2019ve got no one to care for. This is the worst thing that\u2019s happened to me. I guess worse things happen at sea."
