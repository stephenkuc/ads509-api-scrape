"Frank Turner - Once We Were Anarchists Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n The demonstrations got boring \u2013 Well it was obvious that the government was ignoring us. It\u2019s hard to drag yourself through empty streets On an empty stomach and no sleep. The shortcomings got clearer, As the price we paid got dearer and dearer. It\u2019s supposed to be a case of give and take \u2013 Well I was feeling the give and making a mistake. And I\u2019ve heard it said that the unexamined life Isn\u2019t much worth living, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re right. But it\u2019s hard to keep on fighting the good fight When no one else seems bothered, yeah, When no one\u2019s on your side. I\u2019ve got friends who are bankers, And it\u2019s an easy rhyme to call them wankers, But I must say I envy the way that they live In a style that\u2019s all take and no give, While I\u2019m playing the Lone Ranger, Riding to the rescue of six billion strangers, Armed with only unoriginal songs And a sense that something\u2019s wrong. And I must admit that I\u2019m tired of saying \u201cno\u201d all the time. But I must admit that I don\u2019t really know what would be right. And if politics is helping all the people then my political career is pretty fucked, Because the truth is I don\u2019t like people all that much. The times they aren\u2019t a-changing \u2013 Yeah, England\u2019s still shit and it\u2019s still raining, And everybody\u2019s jaded and tired and bored And no one lifts a finger because It\u2019s just not in our culture. Our culture is carrion and we\u2019re all vultures, And no one seems bothered by this state of play \u2013 It seems that the stench is with us to stay. So I had a go, I tried examining life. It wasn\u2019t much worth living \u2013 I guess they\u2019re right. And I\u2019m tired of fighting a fight that\u2019s not my fight. But so is everybody else \u2013 we\u2019re all on the same side. I\u2019m young enough to be all pissed off But I\u2019m old enough to be jaded. I\u2019m of the age where I want things to change But with age my hopes have faded. I\u2019m young and bored of being young and bored \u2013 If I was old I could say I\u2019d seen it all before. In short, I\u2019m tired, and in short I\u2019m probably fired. If the revolution doesn\u2019t want me I don\u2019t give a shit."
