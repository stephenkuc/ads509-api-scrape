"Frank Turner - A Decent Cup Of Tea Lyrics | AZLyrics.com \n\n It hadn\u2019t been a day when everything had turned out right \u2013 She called me up and asked me to come over in the night, To make her cups of tea and listen quietly as she starts To list the latest list of bastards who have trampled on her heart. I see her in the nightclubs, I see her in the bars, At rooftop after-parties, or crammed into friends\u2019 cars, And we talk about the weather, and how she drowns her pain in drink, And I nod and never ever dare to tell her what I think. She summers by my seas But winters without me, And she cries into her tea That she\u2019s secretly lonely. And oh me, what am I to do? It\u2019s obvious to me, But she never seems to see That it\u2019s not about the days when everything has turned out right, No it\u2019s more about the moments when she calls me in the night To make her cups of tea and wash the weary worries from her head And then to draw the pain out slowly as I put her into bed. And I slip this information Into all our conversations But she never seems to listen And she never seems to see."
