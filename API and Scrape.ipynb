Critically, this version of Tweepy is *not* on the upgrade path from Version 3, so you will not be able to simply upgrade the package if you are on Version 3. Instead you will need to explicitly install version 4, which you can do with a command like this: `pip install \"tweepy>=4\"`. You will also be using Version 2 of the Twitter API for this assignment. \n",

If it begins with a \"3\" then run the following command, found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5226311/installing-specific-package-version-with-pip), at the command line or in a cell: `pip install -Iv tweepy==4.9`.

    "Twitter limits the rates at which we can pull data, as detailed in [this guide](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits). We can make 15 user requests per 15 minutes, meaning that we can pull $4 \\cdot 15 \\cdot 1000 = 60000$ users per hour. I illustrate the handling of rate limiting below, though whether or not you hit that part of the code depends on your value of `handle`.  \n",
